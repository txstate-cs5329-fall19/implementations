## Java (1.8)

IntelliJ IDE:
* Add Junit5.3 to your classpath to run unit tests under java_test.
* Set the `java` folder as the source directory
* If necessary, set the output paths for the project:
    * File -> Proj. Settings -> Module -> Paths
    * Output: <proj_path>\implementations\java\production\implementations
    * Test output: <proj_path>\implementations\java\test\implementations
 
Building to a JAR:

## C++

### Pre-requisites
You must have an installation of Visual Studio, Visual Studio Community, or Visual Studio Code. 
In the IDE, open the solution `cpp.sln` file

To debug, run Local Windows Debugger. You may want to put a breakpoint on the return line in main()
To build, on the menu toolbar: Build -> Build Project. 
In the output, look the path to cpp.exe, which can be ran as a standalone program. 

Example: 
```
1>Generating Code...
1>cpp.vcxproj -> C:\Users\boris\Documents\01_Projects\implementations\cpp\Debug\cpp.exe
```

## Python (3.5+)
